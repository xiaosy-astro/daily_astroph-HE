IGR J17091-3624 (IGR J17091) is a transient stellar-mass black hole X-ray
binary discovered in 2003. It is well known for its recurrent outbursts
and sporadic highly structured X-ray variability similar to GRS 1915+105
(Altamirano et al. 2011, ApJL, 742, L17; Court et al. 2017, MNRAS, 468,
4748; Wang et al., ApJ 963, 14, 2024). The most recent outburst began in
early February 2025 (ATel #17034, #17038). 

Recent optical observations reported a decrease in the optical flux from
a magnitude of  r'=19.48 +/- 0.04 to a magnitude of r'=20.69 +/- 0.12 between
2025-04-1 and 2025-04-28, indicating that the source had entered into a
quiescent phase (ATel #17166). 

NICER has been monitoring IGR J17091 since the beginning of the outburst.
Triggered by the optical results reported in Atel #17166, we analyzed the
NICER observations of IGR J17091 taken between 2025-04-18 19:16:20 TT and
2025-05-17 23:37:00 TT with a total exposure of ~25 ks. 

IGR J17091 was significantly detected in all our observations, revealing
that although the optical flux is consistent with quiescence levels, IGR
J17091 is declining but still in outburst in X-rays. The 0.5-10 keV light
curve reveals substantial variability, with average count rates changing
between 18 cts/sec and 12 cts/sec over a period of ~2 days. The most recent
observations conducted between 2025-05-15 20:41:20 TT and 2025-05-17 23:37:00
TT reveal an average count rate between 3 and 7 cts/sec. 

NICER will continue to monitor IGR J17091, and we encourage further multiwavelength
observations of this source. NICER is an X-ray telescope operating on the
International Space Station, devoted to time-resolved spectroscopy in the
0.2-12 keV band. The NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team
activities are funded by NASA.
