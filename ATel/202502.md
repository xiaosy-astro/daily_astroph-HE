- A new X-ray transient near the Galactic Center, MAXI J1744-294, was reported
by MAXI on January 2, 2025, with a flux level of 250 mCrab (ATels #16975,
#16983, #17009). Follow-up Swift/XRT observations identified two sources
near Sgr A*: a fainter source consistent with the position of the low-mass
X-ray binary AX J1745.6-2901 (within 10") and a bright uncataloged target
at coordinates 17:45:41.93, -29:00:35 (J2000), with a positional uncertainty
of 6.4" (ATel #17010). The latest NuSTAR observation on February 6, 2025,
confirmed activity from the new source, MAXI J1744-294 (ATel #17031). 

- We observed MAXI J1744-294 with NICER on February 11-12, 2025, for a total
exposure of 2.7 ks. The 0.5-10 keV light curve showed an average count
rate of 105 cts/s without any significant variability in the power density
spectrum in 0.01-100 Hz.  

- We fitted the NICER spectrum using an absorbed power-law model with a disk
blackbody component in the 2-10 keV range. We detect a broad emission line
with a centroid energy of 6.6 &plusmn; 0.9 keV, a line width of 0.4 &plusmn;
0.2 keV, and line normalization of (2 &plusmn; 0.7) &times; 10<sup>-3</sup>,
consistent with both neutral or ionized Fe. Other best-fit spectral parameters
are: nH = (1.1 &plusmn; 0.1) &times; 10<sup>23</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>, inner
disk temperature = 0.57 &plusmn; 0.03 keV, inner disk normalization of
(6100 &plusmn; 1800), and photon index of 3.1 &plusmn; 0.4 with a power-law
normalization of (2.3 &plusmn; 1.3). The unabsorbed and absorbed 2-10 keV
fluxes are (3.9 &plusmn; 0.2) &times; 10<sup>-9</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>
and (8.8 &plusmn; 0.1) &times; 10<sup>-10</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively.
The uncertainties on parameters are reported for the 68% confidence range.

- Because NICER is a non-imaging instrument with a 30 arcmin<sup>2</sup>
field of view, the observation may be affected by AX J1745.6-2901, located
approximately 1.7 arcmin from MAXI J1744-294. However, our measured spectral
that MAXI J1744-294 is likely in a soft state of its ongoing outburst.
Moreover, we note that the Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission may contribute
to the iron band (Yamauchi et al. 2009, PASJ, 61, 225). Follow-up observations
are encouraged.  

- NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space
Station. The NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities
are funded by NASA.  
parameters match well (within uncertainties) with those from NuSTAR, suggesting
